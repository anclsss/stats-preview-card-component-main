## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (okay)

### Links

- Live Site URL: [stats-preview-card-component](https://anclsss.github.io/stats-preview-card-component-main/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 and CSS3 (Flexbox, Media query)

### What I learned

Okay, I must admit this was harder than I expected. It was obvious to use flex-direction: column-reverse for the stats container when you switch it to mobile, but stats just didn't want to center like it's supposed to -> everything aligned perfectly except for the stats, so I cheated a bit to twink it and added a margin-left: 40px; on line 147 in the styles.css :)
I think at this point I would smash my head through the wall if it wasn't for the figma design file.
Maybe I'm just tired and my brain can't function properly and hold this amount of information.
Still struggling with viewport and widths/heights.

### Continued development

Way better responsive design, I'm such a noob.
